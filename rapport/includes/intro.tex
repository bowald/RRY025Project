\section{Introduction}

The goal of the project is to visually enhance an black and white image of a forest scenery using Homomorphic Filtering(from here referred to as \textit{HF}). \\

This report present the design of a HF that the project group finds visually pleasing. 
The method of application is the same as described in the course book in chapter 4.9.6 Homomorphic Filtering but using the highpass gaussian filter described in 4.9.3 Gaussian Highpass Filters \cite{dipBook}. \\

A parameter study of the filters parameters and theirs contribution to the enhanced image followed up by the recommended parameters the group found most visually pleasing. Finally, the conclusion of either the technique is recommended for this type image and application. This conclusion is based on using the same technique on other types of images.
