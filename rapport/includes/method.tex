\section{Method}

An image $f(u,v)$ can be representet using an illumination-reflection model. $f(u,v) = i(u,v) r(u,v)$
The illumination $i(u,v)$ can be charectarize as slow changes in the frequency domain or as glooming light in the spartial domain. While the reflection $r(u,v)$ tends to be rapid changes in the frequenze domain or as edges in the spartial domain. The homomorphic filter works in the frequenzy domain and aims to filter out some of the illumination $i(u,v)$. This results in an incresment in contrast and normalized brightness.

$\mathfrak{F}[f(u,v)] \neq \mathfrak{F}[i(u,v)] \mathfrak{F}[r(u,v)] $
